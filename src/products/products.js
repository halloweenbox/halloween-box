	like home. Deeply antisocial and bitter 
	about the people 	who've made her feel

	find what	she's looking for. However, her 
	newfound peaceful routine is about to 
	change. It's time for her to prove that 
	she can handle the twisted stories she has 
	always loved reading. She will savor the 
	sweet taste of justice and will observe 
	atrocities with a straight face. The 
	villains won't scare her because she's 
	already prepared. Sophia has to start over 
	in a new world where she remains a weak 
	human, shielded only by her rationality. 
	Will her wicked passions finally lead her 
	home or will she be consumed by the 
	darkness she loves so much?`,
