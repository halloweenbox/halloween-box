					I believe <strong>Dr Jekyll and Mr 
					Hyde</strong>	sums up my personality
					pretty well. Professionally, I'm a 
					software developer who loves games 
					and virtual reality. But this page 
					is about my other self, the one 
					hiding behind a spooky persona and 
					sharing her darkest dreams with 
					like-minded people.

				<p className='paragraph'>
					Thank you for stopping by! I see this 
					website as a personal repository of dark 
					fantasy stories	and visual 
					novels.	<strong>halloweenbox.github.io</strong>	is
					(and will probably continue being) 
					<strong> under construction</strong>, 
					but I'm looking forward to filling this 
					place with free stories for all my online
					friends to read! :)

					{'About the stories:'}
				</h4>
				<p className='paragraph'>
					I usually avoid clich√©s but my
					stories are definitely <strong>not for
					everyone</strong>. You may see themes 
					related	to incest, polyamory, LGBT+ 
					and BDSM,	and rest assured that there's 
					explicit sex and violence included.
					I can only write stories with	female 
					protagonists who are bitter, smart, 
					unattractive and tactful. Innocent or 
					sassy heroines are usually rivals.	As 
					for the male protagonists, you can 
					expect <strong>all sorts of bad
					</strong> such as: demons, vampires, 
					aliens, monsters, dragons, psychopaths 
					and villains.
